## ðŸŽ¯ Core Value Prop Ads (Understanding the Real Problem)

### Ad 1: The Pixel Seasoning Truth
**Primary Text:**
Your Facebook Pixel isn't broken. It's starving.

See, Facebook needs 50+ conversions per week to exit "Learning Limited" - but at Â£20 cost per conversion, that's Â£1,000/week minimum.

Can't spend Â£4k/month? You're trapped.

But here's what Facebook won't tell you...

There ARE ways to feed your pixel without bleeding money. Our free AI consultant analyzes your exact situation and shows you:
â€¢ How to season a cold pixel (without Â£4k budgets)
â€¢ Why your Business Manager setup is sabotaging attribution
â€¢ Which conversion events actually matter for YOUR business

Takes 2 minutes. The AI asks the RIGHT questions.

### Ad 3: The Overlap Problem Nobody Talks About
**Primary Text:**
Running 3+ campaigns? You're probably bidding against yourself.

It's called audience overlap - and it's the silent budget killer nobody mentions.

When your campaigns compete for the same people, costs spike 40-70%. Facebook profits. You lose.

Our free tool doesn't just detect overlap - it shows you EXACTLY which campaigns are cannibalizing each other and how much it's costing you.

Plus, our AI consultant creates a restructure plan specific to your budget and goals.

### Ad 4: The Business Manager Nightmare
**Primary Text:**
Quick check: Who actually OWNS your Facebook pixel?

If an agency set it up, there's a 67% chance it's not you.

â€¢ They see ALL your data (even after you leave)
â€¢ You can't share the pixel with new partners
â€¢ If they delete it, you lose everything

Our tool checks your Business Manager ownership in 30 seconds. Then our AI consultant shows you exactly how to reclaim control WITHOUT losing your pixel data.
