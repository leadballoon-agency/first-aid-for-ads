## ðŸ“‹ TO DO BEFORE LAUNCHING ADS

### 1. Add Your Tracking IDs to Vercel Environment Variables
Go to Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_PIXEL_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-YOUR_GA_ID
```

### 2. Configure Facebook Pixel Events in Ads Manager
1. Go to Events Manager
2. Verify pixel is firing (use Facebook Pixel Helper Chrome extension)
3. Set up Custom Conversions:
   - **Quality Lead**: When user reaches AI chat (CompleteRegistration event)
   - **Hot Lead**: When spending Â£500+ with pixel installed
   - **URL Analyzed**: Search event

### 3. Campaign Setup Recommendations

#### Targeting
- **Interest targeting**: Facebook advertisers, digital marketers, ecommerce store owners
- **Lookalike audiences**: Create from your existing customer list
- **Behavioral**: Small business owners, online shopping engagement

#### Ad Copy Angles
- "3 Hidden Campaign Killers Destroying Your Facebook Ads"

#### Landing Page Optimizations
The tool currently:
- âœ… Works on mobile
- âœ… Has clear value proposition
- âœ… Shows social proof (beta badge, professional design)
- âœ… Qualifies leads automatically

### 4. Lead Routing Logic (ALREADY CONFIGURED)
The AI automatically routes leads:
- **To Kerry**: Â£500+ monthly spend WITH pixel installed (warm leads for call conversion)
- **To Mark**: Technical issues, no pixel, or budget under Â£500 (needs landing page/setup)

### 5. Testing Before Launch
1. Test the full flow with Facebook Pixel Helper active
2. Verify events fire at each step
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Test with different URLs (with/without pixel)
5. Ensure AI chat loads and responds correctly

### 6. Campaign Budget Recommendations
- Start with Â£20-30/day for testing
- Use ABO (not CBO) initially for better control
- 3-5 ad sets with different audiences
- 2-3 ads per ad set

### 7. Expected Metrics
Based on the tool's qualification process:
- CPM: Â£15-25 (UK B2B audience)
- CTR: 1.5-2.5% (strong hook about campaign problems)
- Conversion Rate to Assessment: 40-60% (low friction, high value)
- Qualified Lead Rate: 15-25% (reach AI chat)
- Cost Per Qualified Lead: Â£8-15

## ðŸš€ Quick Launch Steps
